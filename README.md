# Scala 3 migration guide

This repository is a continuously evolving guide to support the migration to Scala 3. As a member of the community you are encouraged to participate the effort by sharing your migrating experience.
Visit https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-3-migration-guide to learn more about the migration guide.

A number of complementary initiatives are being undertaken to ease the migration. This repository is not a replacement of those initiatives. Its purpose is to gather knowledge, to collect feedback and to encourage the collaboration. The ultimate goal being to drive the effort of the community toward the release of Scala 3.

All information you may want to know before starting the migration of your codebase should be available in this guide. If not you may want to [contribute](docs/contributing.md).
