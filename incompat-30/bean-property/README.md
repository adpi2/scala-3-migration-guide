## Invisible Bean Property

The getter and setter methods generated by the `BeanProperty` annotation are now invisible in Scala because their primary usecase is the interoperability with Java frameworks.

Given `pojo` an instance of the class `Pojo` defined as below:

```scala
class Pojo() {
  @BeanProperty var fooBar: String = ""
}
```

You cannot call `pojo.getFooBar()` nor `pojo.setFooBar("")` in Scala 3 anymore.

The solution is to call the more idiomatic `pojo.fooBar` getter and setter.

```scala
println(pojo.fooBar)
pojo.fooBar = "hello"
```
